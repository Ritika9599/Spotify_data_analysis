# Spotify Data Analysis

This is a capstone project where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Spotify tracks dataset to identify patterns and understand the characteristics of popular songs.

## 📌 Objective

The aim of this project was to explore the Spotify dataset and gain insights into:
- Which types of songs tend to be more popular
- How features such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and duration relate to popularity
- Trends in songs released over different years

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- ### 🔎 Key Insights

- Most of the songs in the dataset have **shorter duration** (right-skewed distribution) and were released mostly between **1950–2010**.
- **Popularity has increased over the decades**, especially after the 1960s.
- **Danceability and energy have a positive relationship** → more danceable songs tend to be more energetic.
- **Acousticness has a strong negative correlation with energy and popularity**, meaning more acoustic songs are usually **less energetic and less popular**.
- **Loudness and energy** show a strong positive correlation (louder songs are more energetic).
- The most frequent artists in the dataset include *Sound Dreamer* and *Sound for Life* with very high average track durations.

### ✅ Conclusion

Overall, popular Spotify songs are usually energetic, loud, danceable, and were released in the recent decades, whereas highly acoustic and instrumental songs tend to be less popular.
